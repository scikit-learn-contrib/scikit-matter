def pairwise_euclidean_distances(
    X, Y=None, *, Y_norm_squared=None, squared=False, X_norm_squared=None, cell=None
):
    """
    Compute the pairwise distance matrix between each pair from a vector array X and Y.

    For efficiency reasons, the euclidean distance between a pair of row
    vector x and y is computed as::

        dist(x, y) = sqrt(dot(x, x) - 2 * dot(x, y) + dot(y, y))

    This formulation has two advantages over other ways of computing distances.
    First, it is computationally efficient when dealing with sparse data.
    Second, if one argument varies but the other remains unchanged, then
    `dot(x, x)` and/or `dot(y, y)` can be pre-computed.

    However, this is not the most precise way of doing this computation,
    because this equation potentially suffers from "catastrophic cancellation".
    Also, the distance matrix returned by this function may not be exactly
    symmetric as required by, e.g., ``scipy.spatial.distance`` functions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : {array-like, sparse matrix} of shape (n_samples_X, n_features)
        An array where each row is a sample and each column is a feature.

    Y : {array-like, sparse matrix} of shape (n_samples_Y, n_features), \
            default=None
        An array where each row is a sample and each column is a feature.
        If `None`, method uses `Y=X`.

    Y_norm_squared : array-like of shape (n_samples_Y,) or (n_samples_Y, 1) \
            or (1, n_samples_Y), default=None
        Pre-computed dot-products of vectors in Y (e.g.,
        ``(Y**2).sum(axis=1)``)
        May be ignored in some cases, see the note below.

    squared : bool, default=False
        Return squared Euclidean distances.

    X_norm_squared : array-like of shape (n_samples_X,) or (n_samples_X, 1) \
            or (1, n_samples_X), default=None
        Pre-computed dot-products of vectors in X (e.g.,
        ``(X**2).sum(axis=1)``)
        May be ignored in some cases, see the note below.

    Returns
    -------
    distances : ndarray of shape (n_samples_X, n_samples_Y)
        Returns the distances between the row vectors of `X`
        and the row vectors of `Y`.

    --------
    paired_distances : Distances between pairs of elements of X and Y.

    Notes
    -----
    To achieve a better accuracy, `X_norm_squared` and `Y_norm_squared` may be
    unused if they are passed as `np.float32`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import euclidean_distances
    >>> X = [[0, 1], [1, 1]]
    >>> # distance between rows of X
    >>> euclidean_distances(X, X)
    array([[0., 1.],
           [1., 0.]])
    >>> # get distance to origin
    >>> euclidean_distances(X, [[0, 0]])
    array([[1.        ],
           [1.41421356]])
