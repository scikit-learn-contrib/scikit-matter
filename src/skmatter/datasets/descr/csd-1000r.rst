CSD-1000R
#########

This dataset, intended for model testing, contains the SOAP power spectrum features and
local NMR chemical shieldings for 100 environments selected from CSD-1000r, originally
published in [Ceriotti2019]_.

Data Set Characteristics
------------------------

:Number of Instances: Each representation 100

:Number of Features: Each representation 100

The representations were computed with [C1]_ using the hyperparameters:

:rascal hyperparameters:

+---------------------------+------------+
| max_radial:               |      6     |

Of the 2'520 resulting features, 100 were selected via FPS using [C2]_.

Chemical Properties
-------------------

The CSD-1000R dataset consists of 100 atomic environments selected from crystal structures in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) [C3]_. These environments represent a diverse set of chemical compositions and bonding types, including:

- Metals, metalloids, and non-metals
- Covalent, ionic, and metallic bonding environments
- Various coordination numbers and geometries

The dataset captures local chemical environments relevant for modeling properties such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shieldings, aiding in the understanding of structure-property relationships in materials chemistry.

For more detailed chemical information, users can refer to the original Cambridge Structural Database [C3]_ or the publication by Ceriotti et al. (2019) [C4]_
