class VoronoiFPS(GreedySelector):
    """
    In FPS, points are selected based upon their Hausdorff distance to
    previous selections, i.e. the minimum distance between a given point and
    any previously selected points. This implicitly constructs a Voronoi
    tessellation which is updated with each new selection, as each unselected
    point "belongs" to the Voronoi polyhedron of the nearest previous selection.

    This implicit tessellation enabled a more efficient evaluation of the FPS --
    at each iteration, we need only consider for selection those points at the
    boundaries of the Voronoi polyhedra, and when updating the tessellation
    we need only consider moving those points whose Hausdorff distance is
    greater than half of the distance between the corresponding Voronoi center
    and the newly selected point, per the triangle equality.

    .. image:: VoronoiFPS-Schematic.pdf

    To demonstrate the algorithm behind Voronoi FPS, let :math:`*_{m+1}` be a new chosen
    point, :math:`v(j)` was chosen earlier, :math:`j` is a point in the polyhedron with
    center :math:`v(j)`. From the inequalities of the triangle one can easily see that
    if :math:`d(v(j),j)<d(*_{m+1}, j)/2`, then point :math:`j` is guaranteed not to fall
    into the formed polyhedron and the distance to it can be uncalculated.

    This algorithm is particularly appealing when using a non-Euclidean or
    computationally-intensive distance metric, for which the
    decrease in computational time due to the reduction in distance
    calculations outweighs the increase from book-keeping. For simple
    metrics (such as Euclidean distance), VoronoiFPS will likely not
    accelerate, and may decelerate, computations when compared
    to FPS.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_trial_calculation: int, default=4
        Number of calculations used for the switching point between Voronoi FPS
        and traditional FPS (for detail look at full_fraction).
    full_fraction: float, default=None
        Proportion of calculated distances from the total number of features at
        which the switch from Voronoi FPS to FPS occurs.
        At a certain number of distances to be calculated,
        the use of Voronoi FPS becomes unreasonably expensive due to the associated
        costs connected with reading data from the memory. The switching point
        depends on many conditions, and it is determined "in situ" for optimal
        use of the algorithm. Determination is done with a few test calculations
        and memory operations.
