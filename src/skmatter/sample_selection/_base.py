    Parameters
    ----------

        value when fit starts. Stored in :py:attr:`self.initialize`.

    n_to_select : int or float, default=None
        The number of selections to make. If `None`, half of the samples are selected.
        If integer, the parameter is the absolute number of selections to make. If float
