Install from source
-------------------

For development purposes you should clone the repository and install the current
development version from the source code

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone https://github.com/lab-cosmo/scikit-matter
  cd scikit-matter
  pip install .

Alternatively, if you don't have special privileges, install
the package using the ``--user`` flag:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install . --user

You're ready to import skmatter from your code! Have a look at the :ref:`api-reference`
for how to use the code.
