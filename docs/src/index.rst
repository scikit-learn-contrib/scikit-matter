scikit-matter documentation
===========================

``scikit-matter`` is a collection of `scikit-learn <https://scikit.org/>`_ compatible
utilities that implement methods born out of the materials science and chemistry
communities.

Convenient-to-use libraries such as scikit-learn have accelerated the adoption and
application of machine learning (ML) workflows and data-driven methods. Such libraries
have gained great popularity partly because the implemented methods are generally
applicable in multiple domains. While developments in the atomistic learning community
have put forward general-use machine learning methods, their deployment is commonly
entangled with domain-specific functionalities, preventing access to a wider audience.

scikit-matter targets domain-agnostic implementations of methods developed in the
computational chemical and materials science community, following the scikit-learn API
and coding guidelines to promote usability and interoperability with existing workflows.
scikit-matter contains a toolbox of methods for unsupervised and supervised analysis of
ML datasets, including the comparison, decomposition, and selection of features and
samples.
