CHANGELOG file
--------------

The rules for CHANGELOG file:

- entries are sorted newest-first
- summarize sets of changes (do not reproduce every git log comment here).
- do not ever delete anything
- keep the format consistent (88 char width, Y/M/D date format) and do not use tabs but
  use spaces for formatting
